        <h1 class="text-4xl font-bold mb-4">Our Methodology</h1>
        <p class="mb-4">
            At <span class="font-bold">Pipette Digest</span>, our mission is to bring the most impactful scientific research into the spotlight. How do we do this? Through a meticulous process powered by our proprietary algorithm. Here's a glimpse into our methodology:
        </p>
        
        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-8 mb-2">Comprehensive Scanning</h2>
        <p class="mb-4">
            Each week, we delve into a wide array of high-impact journals, seeking out papers published within the last seven days. Our aim is to stay as current as possible, ensuring that our subscribers receive the freshest insights right at their fingertips.
        </p>
        
        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-8 mb-2">Curated Ranking</h2>
        <p class="mb-4">
            Our proprietary algorithm doesn’t just skim the surface; it dives deep, evaluating each paper against five stringent criteria to determine its place in our weekly roundup:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-8 mb-4">
            <li class="mb-2">Field Contribution: We assess the paper’s significance to its own field and its potential to influence related disciplines.</li>
            <li class="mb-2">Results Impressiveness: We look for studies with results that are not only statistically significant but also carry profound implications.</li>
            <li class="mb-2">Methodological Innovation: We value creative and novel approaches, prioritizing research that challenges traditional paradigms and introduces innovative methods.</li>
            <li class="mb-2">Societal Impact: Science doesn’t exist in a vacuum. We highlight research with the potential to affect society positively, pushing beyond the academic realm.</li>
            <li class="mb-2">Foundation for Future Work: We seek out studies that aren’t just endpoints but springboards for further research, inspiring new questions and exploration.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-8 mb-2">Expert Review</h2>
        <p class="mb-4">
            While our algorithm sets the stage, the human touch is irreplaceable. Our team of experts conducts a thorough review to ensure that the selected papers not only meet our criteria but also resonate with our readers.
        </p>
        
        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-8 mb-2">Summarization and Delivery</h2>
        <p class="mb-4">
            Finally, we distill the essence of these high-impact papers into concise summaries, providing you with the knowledge you need to stay informed, engaged, and inspired.
        </p>
